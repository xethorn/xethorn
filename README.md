<h2 align="center">Hello • Bonjour • La Orana • こんにちは.</h2>

I'm Michael, a French-American software engineer currently working at [@GlossGenius](https://github.com/google). I believe in creating software to empower others achieve their dreams and reach higher ground, from creatives to business wellness owners. Throughout my years in tech, I worked at small and large companies such as [@Google](https://github.com/google), [@YouTube](https://github.com/youtube), , [@Pinterest](https://github.com/pinterest), [@Square](https://github.com/square), [@CashApp](https://github.com/cashapp) leading high-scale initiatives. 

Known for being the architect behing YouTube's largest redesigns (2011, 2012); laying Pinterest's foundations for high-scale user adoption (personalization, internationalization, ads); revamping Square APIs, Customer and Buyer Platform; and exponentially growing GlossGenius.
