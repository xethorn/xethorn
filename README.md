Known for being the architect behing YouTube's largest redesigns (2011, 2012); laying Pinterest's foundations for high-scale user adoption (personalization, internationalization, ads); revamping Square APIs, Customer and Buyer Platform; rewriting CashApp's payment platform and leading internationalization efforts.
