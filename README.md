<h2 align="center">Hello • Bonjour • La Orana • こんにちは.</h2>

I'm [Michael](https://linkedin.com/in/xethorn), a French-American software engineer currently working at [@GlossGenius](https://github.com/glossgenius). I believe in creating software that empowers others achieve their dreams and reaching higher grounds, from creatives to business owners. Throughout my years in tech, I worked at small and large companies such as [@Google](https://github.com/google), [@YouTube](https://github.com/youtube), , [@Pinterest](https://github.com/pinterest), [@Square](https://github.com/square), [@CashApp](https://github.com/cashapp) leading high-scale initiatives. 

Known for being the architect behind YouTube's most consequential and largest redesigns (2011, 2012); laying Pinterest's foundations for high-scale user adoption (personalization, internationalization, ads); revamping Square APIs, Customer and Buyer Platform; rewriting CashApp's payment platform and leading internationalization efforts. I'm currently helping GlossGenius evolve its technical stack and engineering organization. 

On my freetime, I'm a proud cat dad that loves to make ramen (or any other Asian-inspired dish) while still finding ways to explore our beautiful blue planet. It's all about having a good time, and living every minute to its fullest.
